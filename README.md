# miso_automations_project

Automation Project:

Part I: General Instructions
● Your assignment should be a Python test suite.
● Your assignment will use what we have learned so far (e.g. conditional statements,
array, array built-in functions, and loop).
● You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code.
● The project should run as one suite and follow a POM approach as possible, with
each test performed at the time you want it to and in logical dependable order where
needed.
● No excuse for late work.
● All identical work will result in zero points for all parties involved.
● Your instructor can help with the explanation of this assignment but won’t help with
debugging your code.

Part II: Specific Instructions
● Students will form groups of three or four members, and each group will have to
create a Python test suite.
● The teams will assign an automation master for the project who will be the one to
perform merges.
● Students should open a project in Git and pull it to a local workspace and assign
automation amager as owner.
● TheAutomation manager will create a Python PyCharm project that will set up a venv
with the required packages and then push it to the remote Git.
● The project should be available for cloning and forking by team members to add their
code respectively.
● it should be private.
● The students are required to design a Traceability Table Test Plan document for each
component (Manual 50%).
● The teams should prepare an std and perform automation for those test cases.
● The website is https://www.demoblaze.com/, and students should cover tests for
each page's basic functionality, including
○ Home
○ About us
○ Cart
○ Signup
○ Sign in
○ Purchasing
etc.

● The part of coding includes the application of the techniques learned during the
course: Fundamentals of Python, Data Types and Variables, Making Decisions
(Logical Expressions, "if" Statements, logical Operators), Lists and Loops, Functions,
Python Classes, OOP, Modules: Requests, unittest, selenium, etc.
● Students can ask the project manager for any questions on desired functionality that
you would ask a product manager.

Part III: Presentation
● The presentation should be designed that includes the entire structure of the project.
● Each participant is required to know all the details of the project in detail!!
● Must use Canva (https://www.canva.com)
Note: Students should incorporate the above instructions into their Python test suite project.
